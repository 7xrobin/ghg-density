  based on the data they input about their emissions. Though this gives individual companies visibility
  on their own emissions, it doesnâ€™t give us a clear idea on our progress on a country level. This task
  addresses the other side of the problem; using satellite data to estimate the amount of GHG emissions
  in the atmosphere over time to measure our actual impact.`;
